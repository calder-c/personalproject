# Physics Simulation with Verlet Integration

## Introduction
This is my IBMYP Personal Project. It is a a 2d physics simulation where you can create and simulate scenarios with 2d rigidbody objects of different size, mass or initial acceleration.



## Features

- Verlet Simulated Points 
- Line Constraints
- Squares and other Convex Shapes
- Pause/unpause and edit anytime!


## Prerequisites
- CMake 3.16 or higher
- SFML 3.0 or higher
## Installation

**Method 1**

Clone the repository with git clone

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/calder-c/personalproject
  cd personalproject
```
Make a new directory for compilation
```bash
  mkdir build
  cd build
```
Build the project
```bash
  cmake ..
  make
```
Run the built file
```bash
./PhysicsSim
```
